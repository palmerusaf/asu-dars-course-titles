# Problem
I got tired of having to click course codes and open a new window just to see the course name.
# Solution 
Scrape as many course names as possible then write a script to add titles to course codes. This way when you hover over the course code the title appears... sometimes.
# Directions
Nav to DARS screen hit f12 then copy paste the following in the dev console

```javascript:./coursesWithTitles.json

```
